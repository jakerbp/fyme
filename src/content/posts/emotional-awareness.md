Markets don't care about your feelings, but your P&L certainly does. Unmanaged emotions are like hidden leaks in your trading edge â€“ slowly draining your confidence and capital.

Common emotional leaks include:
*   **Fear:** Missing good trades or cutting winners too soon.
*   **Greed:** Oversizing positions or chasing FOMO entries.
*   **Hope:** Holding onto losers far past your stop-loss.
*   **Resentment:** Taking revenge trades after a loss.

The first step to plugging these leaks is **awareness**. You can't manage what you don't recognize.

Mental Edge's mood tracking and journaling prompts help you connect specific emotions to trading decisions. By building this self-awareness, you can start to anticipate your triggers and implement strategies to counteract them before they take control.
