How often do you end the trading day judging yourself solely by the net gain or loss? While outcomes matter, fixating on them is like trying to drive by only looking at the rearview mirror. It tells you where you've been, not how to navigate the road ahead effectively.

Consistent profitability isn't born from chasing specific dollar amounts or win rates. It's the **natural byproduct** of consistently executing a well-defined, robust trading process.

Focusing on process means:
*   **Adhering to your entry/exit rules:** Regardless of the previous trade's outcome.
*   **Managing risk consistently:** Applying the same position sizing and stop-loss logic every time.
*   **Reviewing decisions, not just results:** Understanding *why* you took a trade, not just whether it won or lost.
*   **Building repeatable habits:** Making good execution automatic, even under pressure.

When you shift your focus from the unpredictable nature of short-term outcomes to the controllable aspects of your execution, you build confidence, reduce emotional decision-making, and pave the way for the results you desire.

Mental Edge helps you solidify this process-driven approach through structured planning, execution tracking, and insightful reviews.
