How do you review your trading day? A quick look at the profit or loss?Continuously obsessing over it? While P&L matters, it tells you *what* happened, not *why*. Real improvement comes from understanding the decisions, emotions, and rule adherence behind the numbers.

A structured review process is like compound interest for your trading skills. Small, consistent insights build over time into significant improvements.

Mental Edge guides you through tailored period reviews:
*   **Daily:** Capture immediate emotional responses and decision points.
*   **Weekly:** Identify recurring patterns in the short-term and adjust your process if needed.
*   **Monthly:** Assess progress on medium-term goals.
*   **Quarterly:** Make strategic adjustments based on longer trends.
*   **Yearly:** Evaluate long-term strategy effectiveness.

Instead of just reacting to results, a consistent review ritual helps you proactively refine your process, understand your psychological tendencies, and build a repeatable edge that lasts. Stop guessing, start reviewing.
