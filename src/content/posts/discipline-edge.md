Every trader knows the pain of breaking their rules. You see a setup that *almost* fits, jump in too early, or hold on too long hoping for a reversal. These small deviations seem harmless, but they erode trust in your strategy and chip away at your capital.

True discipline isn't about rigid inflexibility; it's about **consistent execution** of a well-defined plan. It's the bridge between knowing what to do and actually doing it, especially under pressure.

Mental Edge helps you build this bridge by:
*   **Structured Reviews:** Identifying *when* and *why* you break rules.
*   **Habit Formation:** Turning consistent actions into automatic behaviors.
*   **Accountability:** Tracking your adherence to your plan over time.

Discipline isn't glamorous, but it's the bedrock of long-term trading success.
