Section: How It Works

Explain that Mental Edge is an app built specifically for traders who want to build the mental edge that helps good strategies actually work in real life.

Users complete structured Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, and Annual Reviews — each asking tailored questions that build awareness, accountability, and habit formation.

Emotional-awareness modules dive into recurring psychological traps like:

Hope and fantasy

Resentment and control

Guilt, shame, or entitlement

Infatuation with “revenge trades” or “big wins”

Reflective journaling, mood tracking, and actionable prompts included.

Section: Why Traders Use It

Frame this as a benefit-driven section, not a feature list.

Examples:

"Know yourself better than your market bias."

"Spot emotional leaks in your edge before they drain your account."

"Turn review rituals into a long-term edge."

"Stop breaking rules and start understanding why you break them."

Include another Take the Assessment button.

Section: Take the Mental Edge Assessment

Create a teaser intro for the 7-question quiz hosted at /assessment

Text example: "Not sure if you need this? Find out in under 2 minutes."

Include a Take the Assessment CTA

Explain that it helps traders reflect on where they’re currently strong vs vulnerable
